### 2. Contact Form Security Vulnerability (RESOLVED) üîí
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED - VULNERABILITY RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Contact form had no INSERT RLS policy, allowing unrestricted submissions and potential abuse
- **Severity**: ERROR - Potential for spam attacks and data theft
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Added public INSERT policy with comprehensive database-level validation
  - Enhanced edge function with rate limiting (3 attempts per 5 minutes from same IP)
  - Added suspicious content detection and blocking
  - Implemented proper input sanitization against XSS and injection attacks
  - Added DELETE prevention policy (contact submissions cannot be deleted)

### 3. Related Data Security Issues (RESOLVED) üîí
- **Issue**: Patient appointments, treatment photos, and reminders also had overly permissive access
- **Fix Applied**: All patient-related tables now restricted to admin access only
- **Tables Secured**:
  - `patients` - Medical records and personal information
  - `patient_appointments` - Appointment scheduling and medical notes
  - `treatment_photos` - Patient treatment photos
  - `appointment_reminders` - Patient reminder data

## ‚úÖ PREVIOUS SECURITY FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. Database Function Security (CRITICAL - FIXED) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: 18 database functions lacked proper `search_path` protection
- **Fix**: Added `SET search_path = ''` to all security-sensitive functions
- **Impact**: Prevents SQL injection attacks through search path manipulation

### 2. Rate Limiting Security (RE-ENABLED) üõ°Ô∏è
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Rate limiting was disabled for testing in production code
- **Fix**: Re-enabled contact form rate limiting (3 attempts per 5 minutes)
- **Impact**: Prevents brute force attacks and spam submissions

### 3. UI Security Fix (FIXED) üîß
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: React Fragment receiving invalid data-lov-id prop
- **Fix**: Replaced `React.Fragment` with `<>` syntax in PriceCard component
- **Impact**: Eliminates console warnings and improves component stability

### 4. Secure Logging Implementation (PRODUCTION-READY) üìù
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Purpose**: Replace unsafe `console.log` statements with production-safe logging
- **Critical Files Updated**: Authentication, security monitoring, form submissions
- **Features**: Automatic data sanitization, environment-aware logging, structured logging

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive input sanitization and threat detection
- **Protection Against**:
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks
  - SQL injection attempts
  - Command injection attacks
  - Path traversal attacks
- **Features**:
  - Context-aware sanitization (HTML, SQL, filename, email, URL)
